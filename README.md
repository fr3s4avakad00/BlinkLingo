# BlinkLingo - The Morse Code Game

BlinkLingo is an interactive web-based game designed to teach and test your Morse code skills through engaging challenges. Using your webcam, BlinkLingo tracks your eye blinks to input Morse code. Progress through multiple levels, unlock challenges, and master Morse code in a fun and gamified way.

---

## Features
- **Webcam-Based Input**: Detect eye blinks to input dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`) for Morse code.
- **Progressive Levels**: Unlock new levels by completing challenges and scoring points.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: View live updates of your Morse code as you blink.
- **Responsive Design**: Play the game seamlessly across various devices.
- **Local Progress Tracking**: Track your progress and unlocked levels locally.

---

## How It Works
1. Navigate through the menu and select a level to start.
2. Blink your eyes to input Morse code:
   - Short blinks (`< 0.4 seconds`) are interpreted as dots (`.`).
   - Longer blinks (`0.4 - 0.8 seconds`) are interpreted as dashes (`-`).
3. Match the displayed Morse code challenge to score points.
4. Complete challenges to unlock higher levels.

## Technical Details

### Backend
- Built with **Flask**.
- Handles real-time communication using **Socket.IO**.
- Blink detection implemented with **Mediapipe**.

### Frontend
- Interactive UI created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Real-time feedback and level management powered by **Socket.IO**.

## Key Components

1. **Blink.py**:
   - Detects blinks and translates them into Morse code.
   - Handles timing thresholds to differentiate between dots and dashes.

2. **script.js**:
   - Handles real-time communication with the backend.
   - Updates the UI with the current Morse code and challenge progress.

3. **style.css**:
   - Provides a clean and responsive design for the game.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiplayer mode.
- Include more levels and challenges.
- Integrate audio feedback for Morse code.
